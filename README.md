🔍 Simple Python Caesar Cipher Tool
A beginner-friendly Python script that encrypts and decrypts messages using the classic Caesar Cipher. This project helps new learners understand basic cryptographic principles and string manipulation in Python.


🚀 Features:

✅ Encrypts and decrypts alphabetic characters.

🔢 Works with a given shift number.

🔄 Handles invalid input and exceptions gracefully.

📖 Features easy-to-read Python code with comments.


💻 How to Use:
To run this tool, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

🔧 Run from terminal:
python3 caesar_cipher.py

Once the program starts, simply follow the on-screen prompts:
Choose e (encrypt) or d (decrypt).
Enter your message.
Enter the desired shift number (an integer).


Example Usage:

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Tool!
Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt? (q to quit): e
Enter your message: Hello World 
Enter the shift number: 3
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog
Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt? (q to quit): d
Enter your message: Khoor Zruog
Enter the shift number: 3
Decrypted message: Hello World
Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt? (q to quit): q
Exiting program. Goodbye!


Requirements:
🐍 Python 3.x installed on your system.
🖥️ Basic familiarity with using a terminal/command line.


📚 What You'll Learn:
Building this project will teach you fundamental programming concepts and introduce you to basic cryptography:

🧱 How the Caesar Cipher works at a conceptual level.

🔌 The basics of string and character manipulation in Python, including converting between characters and their ASCII values using ord() and chr().

💬 Practical application of modular arithmetic for wrapping around the alphabet.

⚠️ Techniques for handling user input and implementing basic error validation.


💡 Future Improvements:
🔍 Brute-force decryption mode (try all 25 shifts)
🌐 Support for numbers and special characters
🖥️ GUI version using Tkinter
🗃️ Save output to a file (like .txt)


🛠️👣 How to Try This Project (Step-by-Step):
If you'd like to run and experiment with this project on your own system, here's a step-by-step guide:

Go to this project’s GitHub page.

Click the green “Code” button and then choose “Download ZIP”.

Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell on Windows, or Terminal on Linux/macOS).

Navigate into the project folder using the cd command. For example:
cd path/to/your/caesar_cipher

(Remember to replace path/to/your/caesar_cipher with the actual path to the folder where you extracted the project.)

Verify Python installation by typing:
python3 --version


Run the script with the following command:
python3 caesar_cipher.py
Note for Windows users: If python3 doesn't work, try running the script with just python: python caesar_cipher.py.


⚠️ Disclaimer:
This tool is created for educational purposes only.

The Caesar Cipher is a very weak encryption method and should NOT be used for real-world security or sensitive information.

Always ensure you have explicit permission before experimenting with any encryption/decryption tools on others' data or systems.
